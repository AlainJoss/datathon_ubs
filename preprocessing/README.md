# Preprocessing

In this folder we preprocess the data ingested by the EDA, the anomaly detection, and the stability_index.

In order, the preprocessing happens sequentially running the notebooks:
1. exploration_and_cleansing
2. feature_engineering
3. financial_data_integration

Each notebooks provides detailed information about the assumptions made and the motivation behind the chose processing steps.
