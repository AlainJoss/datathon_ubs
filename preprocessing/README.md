## Preprocessing

This folder contains preprocessing scripts for data used in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), anomaly detection, and stability index calculations. The preprocessing is performed sequentially through the following notebooks:

1. **exploration_and_cleansing** - Cleanses and explores data.
2. **feature_engineering** - Develops features necessary for analysis.
3. **financial_data_integration** - Integrates financial data sources.

Each notebook details the assumptions and rationale for the chosen processing steps.
