## README for the Jupyter Notebook Model.ipynb

### Overview

The Jupyter notebook titled Model.ipynb primarily focuses on developing machine learning and deep learning models for anomaly detection and financial advice strategies. 
This notebook includes a mix of code and documentation that outlines the methods used, the process of feature selection, and the application of models to financial data.

### Contents

#### Introduction:

A brief introduction to the challenges and the scope of the notebook, highlighting its focus on anomaly detection using machine learning techniques.

#### Feature Selection:

Features related to rate of change metrics where selected like "likes_per_content_weekly_change", "followers_weekly_change", and "comments_per_likes_weekly_change".

#### Modeling:

Isolation Forest: Implementation of the Isolation Forest algorithm for anomaly detection.
Autoencoder: Development of a simple autoencoder for feature extraction and anomaly detection.

#### Analysis of Results:

Brief analysis and interpretation of the model outputs.
Descriptions of how anomalies detected by the models can be interpreted within a financial context, such as predicting stock price movements based on social media trends.

#### Strategy Design:

Proposal of a financial advice strategy based on the anomalies detected.

#### Evaluation and Conclusion:

Evaluation of the strategy's performance with an accuracy metric.
Discussion of limitations and potential improvements.

#### Conclusion

This notebook provides a detailed approach to using unsupervised learning for detecting anomalies in financial data and leveraging these insights to formulate investment strategies. The methodology outlined combines data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and strategic implementation, culminating in an evaluation of the strategy's effectiveness.
