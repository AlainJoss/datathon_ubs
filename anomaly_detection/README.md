## README for the Jupyter Notebook Model.ipynb

### Overview

The notebook focuses on developing machine learning and deep learning models for anomaly detection and financial advice strategies. 

**Methods Chose:**

Isolation Forest: Implementation of the Isolation Forest algorithm for anomaly detection.
Autoencoder: Development of a simple autoencoder for feature extraction and anomaly detection.

**Financial Strategy:**
Proposal of a financial advice strategy based on the anomalies detected. Evaluation of the strategy's performance with accuracy metric, reaching 61%, which is a good value considering we are talking about financial data.
